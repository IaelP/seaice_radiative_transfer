# Notes for development of RT fortran code and python wrapper

## TLDR

To compile run `make`

For quick and dirty testing use:
```
diff ccsm3_sir_de_output.dat original/ccsm3_sir_de_output.dat
```
This should return nothing if all went well.


## TODO
Write tests in both fortran and python - see Bonnie's email in the top
level notes.md file

Consolidate notes somewhere
