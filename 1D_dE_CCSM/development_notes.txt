# Notes for development of RT fortran code and python wrapper

## TLDR

To compile run `make`

For quick and dirty testing use:
```
diff ccsm3_sir_de_output.dat original/ccsm3_sir_de_output.dat
```
This should return nothing if all went well.


## TODO
Write init.f to hold a common input block that is used in getdat.
Initially this will set the input data but eventually it will just be
a somewhere to set the input variables and some of the constant input
fields.

Remove read statements from getdat and replace with assignments from init

Write tests in both fortran and python - see Bonnie's email in the top
level notes.md file

Consolidate notes somewhere
